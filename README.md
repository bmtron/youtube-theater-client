## WeTube

Welcome to WeTube, the interactive video sharing app that lets you watch your favorite YouTube videos
in real-time with your friends.

To access the live version, click [here](https://bmmeehan3-youtube-theater-app.now.sh/).

That link should bring you to the landing page, which gives a brief description of the app, and provides
a link to either login (if you already have an account) or to register for a new account.

There is also a demo account listed if you just want to check it out without the hassle of creating an 
account.

Once you register an account and login, you will be taken to the main lobby, where you can select
from any of the available rooms to join and start sharing, or create a room of your own.

Once you select a room, you are brought to the theater page, where you can simply add a youtube link to the input field 

![screenshot of link input](https://i.gyazo.com/2d44ab11614b27657eb1243e582a1740.png)

and press 'Submit Video'. The video will automatically start playing on all clients connected to that same room.

There is also a live chat for you to share reactions and thoughts with everyone connected to the room as
well.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
